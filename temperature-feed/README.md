You can use the existing configuration - but if you wish to deploy a contract,
be sure to update `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the new address you receive

4. Contract Deployment (OPTIONAL)

	* Hardhat is already configured, and a contract is deployed. To deploy a new
	contract, first, compile the contract

	```bash
	npx hardhat compile
	```

	* To deploy a contract

	```bash
	npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/TemperatureFeed.ts --network arbitrumOne
	```

	* Add your new contract address to the `.env` file

6. To run

```bash
bun run index.ts
```
